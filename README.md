# Books

A collection of books. Computer Science, Programming, Levels of design, etc.

You may find some classification ambiguous like [Database concepts and fundamentals][db] are under [Computer Science][cs] but [database access languages][dbl] like SQL are under [programming][prog] and Rails framework is under [Ruby][rb]. All frameworks are under their respective programming language.

### List of books

List and comments about available books alphabetically.

Book|Author|Topic|Subtopic|Comment
-|-|-|-|-
[Algo & DS][2]|Niklaus Wirth|[CS][cs]|[Core][cscore]|A classic to understand the basics. A book before its time and forms a base for a book like [CLRS][clrs].
[Beginning Ruby - From Novice to Professional][1]|Peter Cooper|[Prog][prog]|[Rb][rb]| A guide for every type of reader who wants to learn Ruby from the ground up.
[C The Complete Reference][7]|Herbert Schildt|[Prog][prog]|[C][c]|The book gives an in-depth coverage of the C language and function libraries features.
[Clean Code][bob1]|Uncle Bob|[LLD]||A must read for any student of code to develop an actual coder.
[Clean Coder][bob2]|Uncle Bob|[LLD]||So you read Clean Code? You are a coder? Read this to become a programmer.
[Clean Architecture A Craftsman’s Guide to Software Structure and Design][bob3]|Uncle Bob|[LLD]||Writing good code in a necessary condition but not a sufficient one to become a Software Engineer. Keep concepts taught in this book to make any progress professionally.
[Computer Organization and Architecture][3]|William Stallings|[CS][cs]|[Core][cscore]|How does a computer work internally? It is not just a black box doing Input --> Processing --> Output. This cult status book dives deep into how processors process data, how memory works, etc. and teaches the absolute essence of computers.
[Introduction to Algorithms][clrs]|Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein|[CS][cs]|[Core][cscore]|The absolute bible for Algorithms. It can take at least a couple of months before you get comfortable with it. So do not try reading it within a week or two, or skim through it. Algorithms are described in simple pseudo-code, designed to be readable for anyone with some programming experience.
[JS for Cats][5]|[@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden)|[Prog][prog]|[JS][js]|A quick and witty intro to JavaScript. Checkout the book's [github](https://github.com/maxogden/javascript-for-cats). *New version at [book's repo.](https://github.com/maxogden/javascript-for-cats).*
[PlantUML Quick start][8]||[Miscellaneous][misc]||PlantUML is an open-source tool allowing users to create diagrams from a plain text language. Besides various UML diagrams, PlantUML has support for various other software development related formats, as well as visualisation of JSON and YAML files. The language of PlantUML is an example of a domain-specific language.
[The C Programming Language][6]|K&R|[Prog][prog]|[C][c]|The book written by the OGs of the C programming language, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined.
[The Pragmatic programmer - Pragmatic thinking  & learning][10]|Andy Hunt|[LLD][LLD]||It's definitely a must-read book for programmers and even people managing programmers. Initially released in 1999, The Pragmatic Programmer is a book about becoming a Pragmatic Programmer - programmer that's a true professional in their craft.
[Fundamentals of Database Systems][9]|Ramez Elmasri, Shamkant B. Navathe|[CS][cs]|[Db][db]|This is a leading example of a database text that approaches the subject from the technical perspective. It offers more than enough material to choose from as they seek to balance coverage of theoretical with practical material, design with programming, application concerns with implementation issues, and items of historical interest with a view of cutting edge topics.
[YDK-JS][4]|Kyle Simpson|[Prog][prog]|[JS][js]|A 3 chapter masterpiece which builds you as a programmer from scratch. Starting from how to program, then introducing JS and then a deeper dive, this small book has it all. Part of You don't know series of similar books.
